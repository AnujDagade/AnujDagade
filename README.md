### Hi Humans And RobotsðŸ‘‹
---
I am Anuj, currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science I have always wondered how we can develop such amazing machines called computers. Which is at a very low level just moving electrons here and there. I always wanted to learn how computers work thats why I decided to get into the field of computer science. I am also  interested in Space-related things such as Rockets, Rovers, etc.
