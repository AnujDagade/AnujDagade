### Hi Humans And RobotsðŸ‘‹

I am Anuj, currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science I have always wondered how we can develop such amazing machines called computers. Which is at a very low level just moving electrons here and there. I always wanted to learn how computers work thats why I decided to get into the field of computer science.
